 List is a collection which is ordered and changeable and allows duplicate members. 
(Grow and shrink as needed, sequence type, sortable). 
 To use a list, you must declare it first. Do this using square brackets and separate 
values with commas. 
 We can construct / create list in many ways. 
Ex:  
>>> list1=[1,2,3,'A','B',7,8,[10,11]] 
>>> print(list1) 
[1, 2, 3, 'A', 'B', 7, 8, [10, 11
